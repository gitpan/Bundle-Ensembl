Bundle-Ensembl version 0.02
===========================
Authors: Ahamarshan JN 
         www.gpse.org , www.mellorlab.org
Version: 0.03

NOTES:

   Bundle::Ensembl is a package that automates the installation of required perl modules (as of Ensembl Version 45) 
for deploying the Ensembl Genome Browser locally.

For the list of modules installed see the file WHAT_MODULES.txt

Not all modules in the list are throughly required there are Core and Non-Core modules, you may check the website
http://www.ensembl.org/info/software/website/installation/non-ensembl-code.html for core modules and could select only the appropriate ones if need be.

Donot worry if there are failed tests at the end of the installation, they might be as a result of dependency problem with non-core modules.

INSTALLATION

Download the package
then
gunzip Bundle_Ensembl-v0.03.tar.gz
tar -xvf Bundle_Ensembl-v0.03.tar
cd Bundle_Ensembl_v0.03/

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

you may install it from your terminal with this command (check if you have permissions or 'su' account)

perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Ensembl';

Follow the on-screen guide....

or you may use the CPAN shell to install
$ perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan>install Bundle::Ensembl

for offline installation you need to download the entire module collection
I will try to make it available as one complete package here
www.gpse.org

More information on the modules and installation instructions are available here

http://www.ensembl.org/info/software/website/installation/non-ensembl-code.html
&
http://www.ensembl.org/info/software/website/installation/index.html

TESTING:

To test if all the modules necessary are installed 
use this script ens_modtest.pl
as 
$perl ens_modtest.pl

Best Practise:
For best update your CPAN version by installing
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::CPAN';
then reload CPAN
Some dependent packages that are needed are
ftp, ncftpd, lynx, expat (http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/) most are available as rpm's 
see http://rpmfind.net
some like libtidy and tidy might help for advanced configurations but not needed.
Its better to have these installed.
Also check if your firewall is configured properly or you may want to switch it to passive state for enabling smooth ftp download, ask your system admin before doing this.
